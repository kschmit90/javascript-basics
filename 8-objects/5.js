// Optional: Modify your Rock-Paper-Scissors game so that instead of using if / else if / else blocks to determine the winner, it instead uses an object as a referee. First create an object which has "rock", "paper", and "scissors" as keys, and the moves they win against as the corresponding values. Treat player 1's move as the key, and then check to see if Player 2's move matches the corresponding value.

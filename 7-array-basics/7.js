// Optional: Imagine that you have a hallway which has 500 switches, and that each switch has a corresponding bulb right next to it. All the switches start in the "off" position. You start at switch #1 and count up by 1's, flipping every switch until you get to the end. Then you come back to the beginning, and repeat the process starting at switch #2 and flipping every second switch (and so on until you are all the way done with the hallway). By the time you start with the 500th switch, thus completing the process, which switches are on, and which ones are off? Use an array with 501 elements to simulate this hallway (ignore element 0), as well as a nested loop structure to simulate this problem. As a hint, it may be easiest to simulate the switches as booleans, though you can use strings, symbols, integers, or any of a number of other methods. With the switches that are on, what common numeric property makes those the ones that are left on?
